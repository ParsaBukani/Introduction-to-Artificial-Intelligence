# Chaos Warehouse — Informed & Uninformed Search

_Intro to Artificial Intelligence — University of Tehran_

In this project, the problem of storing scream capsules in **Monstropolis’ Chaos Warehouse** is modeled as a search problem.  
Mike Wazowski must push boxes to their target locations within a grid-based warehouse, navigating **walls, portals, and constraints**.  
The task is to implement and compare **uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, IDS)** and **informed search algorithms (A\*, Weighted A\*)**, analyzing their performance on various maps.


## Tasks

1.  **Problem Modeling**
    -   Define the warehouse as a search space with states, actions, initial and goal configurations.
    -   Handle constraints such as walls, portals, and the inability to push multiple boxes.

2.  **Algorithms Implemented**
    -   **Uninformed Search:** BFS, DFS, IDS  
    -   **Informed Search:** A\* with at least one admissible heuristic, Weighted A\* with different weight factors.

3.  **Testing & Evaluation**
    -   Run algorithms on provided warehouse maps.  
    -   Compare **solution length, number of visited states, and runtime**.  
    -   Analyze heuristic choices and their impact on A\* performance.
