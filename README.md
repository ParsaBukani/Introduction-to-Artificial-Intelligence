# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

This repository contains a series of projects developed for the course  
**“Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)”**, offered by the  
**Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering**,  
**University of Tehran – Spring 1403-1404**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Fadaei** and **Dr. Yaghoubzadeh**.

## Overview

The projects cover a broad range of **classical AI techniques**, including:
- **Search algorithms** (uninformed: BFS, DFS, IDS; informed: A\*, Weighted A\*)  
- **Genetic algorithms**  
- **Adversarial game search** (Minimax with Alpha–Beta pruning)  
- **Machine learning models** (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Scratch implementations)  
- **Neural networks** (Fully Connected and Convolutional, using PyTorch)  
- **Unsupervised learning** (Clustering with K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, feature extraction with Transformers)
